# Password Generator

## Purpose
A web based tool to generate a random password for users ranging from 8 to 128 characters using lower and upper case letters, symbols and numbers
Built for Vanderbilt Coding Bootcamp Challenge 3

Users can generate their own randomized passwords. Users simply click on the generate password button and answer a few prompts about the length of password they would like to generate and the characters tehy would like to use in the password. The lenght of the password cannot be less than 8 characters or greater than 128 characters. Additoinally, users must select at least one character type to use in their password. If the length does not fall within that range and one character type is not selected, users will recieve an error and need to make selections that align with the criteria listed above.
